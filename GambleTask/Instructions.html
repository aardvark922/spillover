        This is an individual task. Each of you will take part in an Option Selection Task. You will be shown five
        options
        and will be asked to choose the one you prefer. Each option has two possible outcomes, both with equal ({{C.probability}}%)
        chance
        of occurring. Your earnings from this task will depend on which option you choose, and which outcome occurs.
    </p>
    <p>The options are as follows: </p>

    {{ include C.TABLE_INSTRUCTION_TEMPLATE }}
    <p>
        After you have chosen one of these options, the computer will randomly draw a whole number between 1 and 100
        (inclusive). If the random number is {{C.probability}} or less, your earnings from this task are as shown in the middle column
        of
        the table. If the random number is {{probability_low}}  or more, your earnings from this task are as shown in the right column of
        the
        table. The random number drawn for you may be different from the ones drawn for other participants.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once everyone has chosen an option, you will proceed to the next task.
    </p>

    <p>At the end of the experiment, you will be informed of the results of this task: your choice of option, your
        random
        number, and your earnings from this part.</p>
