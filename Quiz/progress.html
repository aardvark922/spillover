<!--
Simplest way to calculate the "max" is to run through the experiment
once and then see what participant.progress is at the very end,
then plug that in here.

if you want a prettier progress bar, you can use Bootstrap's.

<h5>
    <label>Question {{ participant.progress }} of {{subsession.max_progress}}
        <progress value="{{ participant.progress }}" max="{{subsession.max_progress}}">
        </progress>
    </label>
